## sudoers file.
## Filled with comments and defaults from both Arch Linux and Fedora
##
## Sudoers allows particular users to run various commands as
## the root user, without needing the root password.
##
## This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
## Failure to use 'visudo' may result in syntax or file permission errors
## that prevent sudo from running.
##
## See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.

## Host Aliases
## Groups of machines. These may include host names (optionally with
## wildcards), IP addresses, network numbers or netgroups.
# Host_Alias  FILESERVERS  = fs1, fs2
# Host_Alias  MAILSERVERS  = smtp, smtp2
# Host_Alias  WEBSERVERS   = www1, www2, www3

## User Aliases
## These aren't often necessary, as you can use regular groups
## (ie, from files, LDAP, NIS, etc) in this file - just use %groupname
## rather than USERALIAS
# User_Alias  ADMINS = jsmith, mikem, millert, dowdy, mikef

## Command Aliases
## Groups of commands.  Often used to group related commands together.

## Networking
# Cmnd_Alias NETWORKING = /sbin/route, /sbin/ifconfig, /bin/ping, \
#                         /sbin/dhclient, /usr/bin/net, /sbin/iptables, \
#                         /usr/bin/rfcomm, /usr/bin/wvdial, /sbin/iwconfig, \
#                         /sbin/mii-tool

## Installation and management of software
# Cmnd_Alias SOFTWARE   = /bin/rpm, /usr/bin/up2date, /usr/bin/yum

## Services
# Cmnd_Alias SERVICES   = /sbin/service, /sbin/chkconfig

## Updating the locate database
# Cmnd_Alias LOCATE     = /usr/bin/updatedb

## Storage
# Cmnd_Alias STORAGE    = /sbin/fdisk, /sbin/sfdisk, /sbin/parted, \
#                         /sbin/partprobe, /bin/mount, /bin/umount

## Delegating permissions
# Cmnd_Alias DELEGATING = /usr/sbin/visudo, /bin/chown, /bin/chmod, /bin/chgrp

## Processes
# Cmnd_Alias  PROCESSES = /usr/bin/nice, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/renice, \
#                         /usr/bin/pkill, /usr/bin/top, /usr/bin/killall

## Power management
# Cmnd_Alias  REBOOT    = /sbin/halt, /sbin/reboot, /sbin/poweroff

## Drivers
# Cmnd_Alias DRIVERS    = /sbin/modprobe

# Defaults specification
## Defaults specification
##
## You may wish to keep some of the following environment variables
## when running commands via sudo.
##
## Locale settings
# Defaults env_keep += "LANG LANGUAGE LINGUAS LC_* _XKB_CHARSET"
##
## Run X applications through sudo; HOME is used to find the
## .Xauthority file.  Note that other programs use HOME to find   
## configuration files and this may lead to privilege escalation!
# Defaults env_keep += "HOME"
##
## X11 resource path settings
# Defaults env_keep += "XAPPLRESDIR XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH"
##
## Desktop path settings
# Defaults env_keep += "QTDIR KDEDIR"
##
## Allow sudo-run commands to inherit the callers' ConsoleKit session
# Defaults env_keep += "XDG_SESSION_COOKIE"
##
## Uncomment to enable special input methods.  Care should be taken as
## this may allow users to subvert the command being run via sudo.
# Defaults env_keep += "XMODIFIERS GTK_IM_MODULE QT_IM_MODULE QT_IM_SWITCHER"
##
## Uncomment to use a hard-coded PATH instead of the user's to find commands
# Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
##
## Uncomment to send mail if the user does not enter the correct password.
# Defaults mail_badpass
##
## Uncomment to enable logging of a command's output, except for
## sudoreplay and reboot.  Use sudoreplay to play back logged sessions.
# Defaults log_output
# Defaults!/usr/bin/sudoreplay !log_output
# Defaults!/usr/local/bin/sudoreplay !log_output
# Defaults!REBOOT !log_output

#
# Refuse to run if unable to disable echo on the tty.
#
Defaults   !visiblepw

Defaults    env_reset
Defaults    env_keep =  "COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE INPUTRC KDEDIR LS_COLORS"
Defaults    env_keep += "MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE"

## User Privileges
## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on which
## machines (the sudoers file can be shared between multiple systems).
## Syntax:
##    user  MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL

## Allows members of the 'sys' group to run networking, software,
## service management apps and more.
# %sys  ALL = NETWORKING, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, STORAGE, DELEGATING, PROCESSES, \
#             LOCATE, DRIVERS

## Allows people in group wheel to run execute any command
%wheel  ALL=(ALL) ALL
## Same thing without a password
# %wheel  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

## Allows members of the users group to mount and unmount the cdrom as root
# %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /mnt/cdrom, /sbin/umount /mnt/cdrom

## Allows members of the users group to shutdown this system
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

## Uncomment to allow any user to run sudo if they know the password
## of the user they are running the command as (root by default).
# Defaults targetpw  # Ask for the password of the target user
# ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL  # WARNING: only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d
## (the '#' here does not indicate a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
